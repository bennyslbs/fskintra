    - Android Chrome M39 introduces a manifest that helps you refine the behavior of the Add to Homescreen link.
      - Non-default :: Standalone. In this mode, Android Chrome gives a little more "native" style to the opened page. In particular, it lets you enforce the start URL and screen orientation. It also remove the navigation bar and gives your web site its own tab in the task switcher. 
        ... if standalone, then the last lines of manifest.json are:
#+begin_src
	],
    "display": "standalone"
}
#+end_src

#+begin_src

}
#+end_src
